== IBM Proactive Technology Online ==
IBM Proactive Technology Online is an open source complex event processing engine developed at IBM Research - Haifa. It provides language primitives for defining,
submitting, and executing event processing networks. The goal of the system is to respond to raw events and identify meaningful events within contexts. 
The system comes with a set of built-in operators (such as sequence, all, etc.) for determining CEP patterns. 
It also has extendable APIs for adding additional custom operators. The system comes with existing source/sink adapters, allowing it to extract raw events from files or pull 
them from RESTful services. It also provides extendable APIs for adding more adapter types. 

=== The repository includes ===
.The Proton standalone version. This includes:
- The Proton J2SE version, which is just a simple Java app running the Proton engine. This can be found under ProtonJ2SE project.
- The Proton web version, providing a RESTful interface for sending events, and also the admin app for managing Proton apps. Those are the ProtonOnWebServer and ProtonOnWebServerAdmin projects respectively.
This is a version of the engine adapted to run on a web server. It allows users to push RESTful events to the engine in addition to pulling 
RESTful events option provided by the REST adapter. This version also provides 	REST APIs for managing the engine’s instance lifecycle, and managing the definition repository.
- The Proton web UI, providing authoring environment for Proton applications. Those are the AuthoringTool and AuthoringToolWebServer projects.
.The Proton on STORM version, which allows to run the engine in a distributed manner on multiple machines using STORM infrastructure.

=== For working with source code ===
The projects are maven projects, they can be built using the "clean install" targets by running mvn command on the parent pom (located in the "Proton) directory. This command will build all the
Proton projects.

Additionaly, by executing the "mvn deploy"	command of the same parent pom after performing clean install, the target jars will be installed into local repository named "mvn-repo" (/Proton/maven-repo).

=== For working with artifacts ===
The https://github.com/ishkin/Proton/tree/master/mvn-repo/com/ibm/hrl contains all the built artifacts. 

For standalone engine, the ProtonJ2SE artifact (located in mvn-repo under com.ibm.hrl.proton/ProtonJ2SE/<version> folder)  also includes a .zip distribution, with ProtonJ2SE executable jar, launch script, sample and docs directory.
